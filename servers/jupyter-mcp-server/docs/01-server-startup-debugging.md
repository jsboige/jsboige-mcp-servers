# Debugging Jupyter Server Startup Issues

This document details the process of debugging and resolving a persistent startup failure in the `jupyter-mcp-server`.

## 1. The Problem: `Timed out waiting for Jupyter server file`

The `start_jupyter_server` tool consistently failed with a timeout error. Analysis of the `jupyter-mcp-debug.log` revealed the root cause: the Jupyter server was starting with a security token, causing the MCP's health checks to the Jupyter API to be rejected with `403 Forbidden` errors.

## 2. Investigation and Failed Attempts

Several methods were attempted to disable the token authentication:

*   **Command-Line Arguments**: Various flags like `--ServerApp.token=''`, `--LabApp.token=''`, and `--no-password` were used. These proved ineffective; the server continued to generate a token.
*   **User-Level Configuration**: A `jupyter_server_config.py` file was placed in the default `C:\Users\jsboi\.jupyter` directory. This also failed, likely due to the spawned process not inheriting the correct user environment.

## 3. The Solution: Local and Explicit Configuration

The successful solution involved making the configuration explicit and independent of the execution environment.

### Step 1: Create a Local Configuration File

A new file, `jupyter_server_config.py`, was created in the root of the `jupyter-mcp-server` project with the following content:

```python
c.ServerApp.token = ''
c.ServerApp.password = ''
c.ServerApp.disable_check_xsrf = True
```

### Step 2: Modify the `spawn` Command

The `start_jupyter_server` tool in `src/tools/server.ts` was modified to use the `--config` argument, forcing Jupyter to load our local configuration file. All other authentication-related flags were removed for clarity.

```typescript
// D:/dev/roo-extensions/mcps/internal/servers/jupyter-mcp-server/src/tools/server.ts

// ...
const configPath = path.resolve(__dirname, '..', '..', 'jupyter_server_config.py');

const jupyterProcess = spawn(
  envPath,
  [
    '--no-browser',
    `--config=${configPath}`
  ],
  { stdio: ['ignore', 'pipe', 'pipe'] }
);
// ...
```

## 4. Validation

After recompiling the MCP, the `start_jupyter_server` tool was executed again. The logs confirmed the success of this approach:

*   The server log now contains the message: `All authentication is disabled.`
*   The Jupyter Server URL is clean, without a `?token=` parameter: `http://localhost:8888/lab`
*   The MCP log shows: `Jupyter services initialized successfully.`

This robust solution ensures that the Jupyter server always starts with the required settings, regardless of the user's environment or default Jupyter configuration.
